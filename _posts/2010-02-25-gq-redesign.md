There are a lot of things to like about the new GQ web design.

<ul>
	<li>great black, white and gold colour scheme (with yellow highlights)</li>
	<li>a well-ordered grid</li>
	<li>elegant, uncluttered navigation</li>
	<li>chunky footer</li>
	<li>plenty of whitespace and breathing room around the text</li>
</ul>

One thing - and leaving aside the xbox ad currently turning the home page background into a sea of green bubbles:

I'd be interested to know the rationale behind <em>not</em> using a similar <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> <a href="http://flowplayer.org/tools/scrollable.html">carousel</a> on the <a href="http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/girls/gq-girls/cheryl-cole/girl">individual feature pages</a> as implemented on the <a href="http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/style">section pages</a>. A fresh page-load for every image just feels so clunky these days, and there are surely AJAX solutions to allow a more fluid browsing experience whilst maintaining reasonable loading times.

So what's the reason? Extra pages for serving extra ads? Image bookmarking? Concern about presenting high-quality images without a performance hit, especially on slower connections?

Finally - the typographical double act of Georgia and Arial is undoubtedly a classic combo (used by the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">Guardian</a> and <a href="http://www.arts.ac.uk/">many</a>, many others). But my guess is that with the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/web/news/2009/07/font-face-typekit-and-font-licensing-the-state-of-web-type.ars">gradual evolution of web typography</a>, embracing the <a href="http://craigmod.com/journal/font-face/">potential</a> of the @font-face CSS rule and of <a href="http://wiki.github.com/sorccu/cufon/">Cuf√≥n</a>, sites that use this staple set of <a href="http://safalra.com/web-design/typography/web-safe-fonts-myth/">traditional web-safe fonts</a> will begin to look dated over the next few years.
