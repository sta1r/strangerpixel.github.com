title: 'Why the Folio Society should scrap its membership rules'

---

Call me a greedy consumerist, but these days, if I really want something, I will almost certainly buy it. To be more exact: for items worth up to £50 - something for my bike, clothes, books, DVDs, gadgets - even if the <em>wanting</em> comes without even a slight element of <em>needing,</em> I will tend to gratify my impulses.

I don't buy huge amounts of stuff. For things that cost more than £50, a dose of restraint is added to the decision-making mix. I may still buy the thing - but the point is that below £50, with a must-have item, cost is not a factor that will single-handedly prevent me from clicking 'Buy Now'.
