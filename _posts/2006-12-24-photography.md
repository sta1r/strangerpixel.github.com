If you were looking for photos, visit my brand new <a href="http://www.strangerpixel.com/albums">albums</a> section. Here, thanks to those generous people at <a href="http://www.zenphoto.org" target="_blank">zenphoto</a>, is an efficient open-source PHP image gallery.

Said gallery is now in place thanks to my new hosting arrangements - take a bow, <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/" target="_blank">Dreamhost</a> - which have allowed me access to the required GD library scripts.

High-resolution files, prints and calendars of my photographs are available on request.
