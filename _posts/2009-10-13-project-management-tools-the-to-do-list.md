Having used both <a href="http://basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a> and <a href="http://www.assembla.com/">Assembla</a> as project management tools for over a year now, I'm come to see pros and cons in each system. 

Basecamp is the one I prefer for my freelance projects; Assembla is used by the University web team as a ticketing system. I think on balance these are suitable tools for the job in both settings: Basecamp is very user-friendly and even my least techy clients take to using it over email, while Assembla has more functionality, and offers the granularity a bigger team needs, perhaps at the expense of some usability.

Right now I want to focus on one particular element: the <em>to-do, or task, list</em>.

Ever since Basecamp introduced the ability to comment on to-do items, I've found that a lot of the action in terms of managing and assigning tasks (with the attendant queries and clarifications) tends to happen in the to-do lists. But there's one particular area of functionality that I'd like to see Basecamp include: the <em>variable to-do status</em>.

Let's say you are assigned a to-do item by a client: 'My blog posts aren't going live on schedule' for instance. Let's say there's a protracted to-and-fro pinpointing exactly what is to be fixed and why it broke in the first place. Useful information is very often added to discussions on to-dos, which is why when you check them off, Basecamp doesn't delete them - there's a 'Done' list for you to refer back to later.

But let's say the problem isn't a pressing one, or the justification for assigning the to-do in the first place (i.e. the demand for scheduling) is no longer relevant. In this case, I don't want to mark the point as 'Done', because I didn't fix anything, and I don't want to delete it, because I'd lose all that useful discussion info associated with it. I need what Assembla offers: the ability to close as <em>invalid</em>.

This way, if we ever try to schedule blog posting again, we can refer back to the task and the related discussion, and investigate.

Perhaps a spot of colour-coding is what's required to bring some of Assembla's versatile ticketing technology to the Basecamp to-do list?
