In central London we're practically swimming in free newspapers. There are vendors at every street corner from mid-afternoon, and by 7pm the pavements are littered with discarded copies. There's a massive over-supply of free 'news', printed 'chat' and 'gossip'. So why would you pay even 20p to get more of it?

Or is the answer just blindingly obvious.
