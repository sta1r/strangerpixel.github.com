Having <a href="http://www.strangerpixel.com/2007/08/flat-hunting-with-flash/">flat-hunted previously</a>, lately I've been flatmate-hunting: searching for a replacement tenant for my room in Highgate, north London. As a rule, during the 5 years I've lived in the city, I've found finding new flatmates fairly easy; but, since I've ended up moving out in the quiet month of January, I've been encouraged to get the most out of a few key websites.

<strong>Gumtree</strong>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumtree">Gumtree</a>, 'the UK's biggest website for local community classifieds', has changed a fair bit since I first started using it. I really admired the major redesign that happened (I guess) at some point in 2008: the familiar colour scheme and branding were incorporated into a much smoother experience, preserving the community feel whilst making everything a whole lot easier for the individual - whether posting, buying or selling. As I write it looks like the 'classic' Gumtree is again being superseded by <a href="http://blog.gumtree.com/redesign/">a sexier incarnation</a>.

Is Gumtree the last word in classifieds? Sure: you post, the customers/tenants come running. But this time my response rate has been quite low - 2 physical viewings from 300+ hits on the website. Aside from the fact that this is January and the coldest winter for 30 years, and my room doesn't have a radiator, what could it be?

<strong>Map view</strong>

I blame the gradual demise of the <strong>map view</strong> for property searches. Formerly on Gumtree, you could view a Google map displaying as many properties as your search terms allowed, with a little red tree marking each house, flat or garage. You could type in 'London' and get literally everything on offer. Admittedly, it used to make Safari go wonky, but it was more useable than not.

[Gumtree should correct me if I'm wrong here, but this is my hunch.] In the redesign, with the advent of monetised customer interactions (like paying £4 to have your ad 'bumped' up the listings), the universal map view was replaced by a map that only showed 30 properties per page (by default the top ones in whichever list), leaving the user to click to the next set. Clearly, this privileged the newer posts and incentivised posters to pay that £4 in order to get more hits.

I would like to see Gumtree reinstate the global, un-paged map - because I think it allows greater flexibility of search. Let's say I wanted to view all properties, however recently posted, in a small area near Hampstead Heath. Instead of being able to zoom the map in and see every property, I would now need to page through 10 or more pages of results before a green blob popped up where I wanted it to. Not only that, but every time I load a new result set, the map zooms right out to accommodate all blobs - from Walthamstow to White City.

Sure, I could make my search terms more precise, but the beauty of the global catch-all map is that you don't have to refine anything and thus risk missing somewhere that falls just outside of your terms - you just browse.

<strong>Globrix</strong>

If <a href="http://www.globrix.com/">Globrix</a> did flatshare, they would be my first choice. Theirs is the best property search interface bar none:
<ul>
	<li>awesomely granular search filters</li>
	<li>global map search (properties pop up as you drag the map)</li>
	<li>draggable price slider</li>
</ul>
Not to mention an abundance of stats and graphs on individual property pages, which display everything from median house prices in the area to typical crime rates.

The only problem with Globrix is the trade's apparent lack of confidence in it. Being a search aggregator, it inevitably takes longer to update than estate agents' own websites.
