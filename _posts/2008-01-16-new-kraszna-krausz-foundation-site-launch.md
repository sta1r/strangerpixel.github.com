At the end of December '07 we launched a new website for the <a href="http://www.kraszna-krausz.org.uk/" target="_blank">Kraszna-Krausz Foundation</a>. <!--more-->The project, which I <a href="http://www.strangerpixel.com/web/kraszna-krausz-foundation-redesign/">announced</a> back in July, was part of a relaunch of the Kraszna-Krausz Book Awards, made annually to books on photography and the moving image. The site incorporated a new visual design for the Foundation, and is built on <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" target="_blank">Wordpress</a>. I particularly like the cascading sidebar menu on the left - crisp and punchy. And a credit to the team at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/" target="_blank">Google's Blueprint</a>, elements of whose CSS framework I have deployed in the design.
