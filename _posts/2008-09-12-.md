Today I discovered some encouraging proof that purveyors of high-quality websites may simply not be bothering to design for Internet Explorer 6 any longer. A friend sent me a link to <a href="http://www.pokedstudio.com/">Poked Studio</a>'s site:

Nice work. I especially like the use of opacity on the buttons and panels. Wondering how they implemented this in IE6, I checked it out on my PC. I was amused to find that Poked hadn't made any effort at all to make the layout compatible.

Then I recalled that <a href="http://www.37signals.com/">37signals</a> are <a href="http://37signals.blogs.com/products/2008/07/basecamp-phasin.html">phasing out support for IE6 across all their products</a>. Then I check the stats. On the <a href="http://www.fashion.arts.ac.uk">London College of Fashion</a> website, 68% of visitors use a version of Internet Explorer (down from 77% a year ago).The good stat is that last year, 60% of that 77% used IE6; now, only 36% of 68% are using the world's most retarded browser.

All of which is good news.
