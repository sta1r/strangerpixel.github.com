For the last month or so I have been working on a website redesign for the bespoke embroidery company <a href="http://www.hand-embroidery.co.uk">Hand &amp; Lock</a>. Hand &amp; Lock are a prestigious firm who export their hand-crafted badges, military sashes and flags worldwide. Recently they supplied the set of The Last King of Scotland with authentic shoulder cords and accoutrements.

The redesign will entail a complete overhaul of Hand &amp; Lock's current table-based layouts into standards-compliant CSS. They require a content management system to maintain their site, and they also want their main site content to be better integrated with their existing e-commerce system.

This, together with the <a href="http://www.youtouchedme.com">You Touched Me</a> website - both projects generated indirectly by my current job at <a href="http://www.fashion.arts.ac.uk">London College of Fashion</a> - has seen <a href="http://www.strangerpixel.com">strangerpixel</a> move into a new fashion / fabric niche. It's a fun new world. Who would have thought that there existed a variety of embroidered cord called "Gimp &amp; Twist"?
