<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-165" title="bikeoff" src="http://www.strangerpixel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/bikeoff.jpg" alt="" width="469" height="364" />

I've been pointed towards <a href="http://www.bikeoff.org/">Bikeoff</a> a couple of times now. 'An initiative of the Design Against Crime Research Centre', and based at <a href="http://www.csm.arts.ac.uk/">Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design</a>, it's a laudable venture, and I'm looking forward to reading into it in much more detail. <a href="http://bikeoff.beta.tagmap.co.uk/">Bikeoff TV</a> in particular looks like a nice Google maps / Flash video project.

However, at least superficially, I really do have to slate the design - especially given the extensive list of design personnel listed on <a href="http://www.bikeoff.org/about/">the about page</a>. Here's what I think's wrong:
<ul>
	<li>Table-based design - in this day and age there really is NO reason to be laying out a website using tables. Tables are for tabular data. End of story.Â </li>
	<li>The bubbles around the chunks of content does work alongside the colour-coding to make it easier to separate bits of information - but it still feels cluttered.</li>
	<li>As used (in)famously and stubbornly by <a href="http://www.useit.com/">Jakob Nielsen</a>, that hyperlink blue is the blue that browsers colour link text by default. In this case, <a href="http://www.bikeoff.org/">Bikeoff</a> just hasn't got round to styling its links in the CSS. It looks pretty bad.</li>
</ul>
