I'm spending the longest day of the year in a darkened hall at Alexandra Palace. <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/472718/" target="_blank">Mashed</a> is an event for software and web developers. The general idea is to get together with like-minded coders and 'hack' or build some kind of application in 24 hours. We've had some presentations from the BBC, Yahoo, Lonely Planet (who are today releasing their API exclusively to Mashed attendees before it goes public in 48 hours) and others, and there are prizes on offer for the best hack that utilises some of the data or APIs on offer.

These people are serious. There are around 300 guests, lots of whom have come from across the country and brought sleeping bags. The BBC is here, and several film crews are roaming around. Microsoft is here, but everyone's on a Mac. It's a recipe for productivity: geeks have been left alone in a room with their machines (and free food and coffee). There's even a soldering iron in one corner.

Personally, I'm a little confused, being a bit of a front-end fairy. But <a href="http://tinypla.net" target="_blank">Si</a> is having a good time. He's planning an app that mashes the Lonely Planet image library with data from the <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/hadleycentre/" target="_blank">Hadley Centre</a> for climate research. I might go for a lie down in the 'soft zone'.
