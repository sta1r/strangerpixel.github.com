I made it down to a couple of screenings at the <a href="http://bicyclefilmfestival.com/">Bicycle Film Festival</a> this weekend. On Friday night, I was at the Barbican (officially the worst sign-posted location in central London) to see <a href="http://bicyclefilmfestival.com/2008_site/london/program3.php">Les Ninjas du Japon</a>, a documentary about a Japanese road racing team competing in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_du_Faso">Tour du Faso</a>, a stage race held annually in Burkina Faso.

The bike race is the scene for a wild culture clash: the calm, pale-skinned Japanese battling extreme heat, potholes and herds of farm animals on the rural roads of West Africa. Director Giovanni Giommi cuts back and forth between French-speaking Burkina Faso and the cyclists' home towns in Japan, drawing out the riders' hopes and dreams one minute, the next returning to the race, and the lives of the ordinary <em>Burkinabé</em> drawn into the race as spectators, drivers, commentators or <em>soigneurs</em>.

Prior to the main screening, the organisers presented Natali Fabrizio's short 'Pantani e "Le Tour de France"', a trippy but totally awesome 9 minutes that cut flickery motorbike-cam video of Marco Pantani racing against Indurain in the 1994 Tour, to a pounding house soundtrack. I felt compelled to follow this up with a late-night glut of <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/results?search_query=marco+pantani">Pantani vids on YouTube</a>.

<strong>Update 8/10/08:</strong>

On Sunday afternoon I returned to BFF08 to catch a bonus screening of <a href="http://bicyclefilmfestival.com/2008_site/london/program2.php">Road to Roubaix</a>, directed by David Deal and David Cooper. The film is a documentary about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris-Roubaix">Paris-Roubaix</a> one-day road race, that has taken place every April since 1896 on the cobbled roads of northern France and Belgium.

The opening minutes were a real buzz - lots of gritty black and white footage of tough guys riding through clouds of mud and dust, the whites of their eyes standing out from faces caked in dirt and sweat. An early highlight was the interview with Lance Armstrong, who described the 200km route - the <em>Queen of the Classics</em>, which he has famously never entered - as 'insane'.

However the 75 minutes included too many talking heads offering similar viewpoints. An hour in, we pretty much got the message that the race was hard. Road to Roubaix was less successful where I hear (not having seen it) that Jørgen Leth's 1977 documentary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Sunday_in_Hell">A Sunday in Hell</a> was in a class of its own: namely, in offering an up-close analysis of the actual riding of the race, the changing fortunes, the bursts of speed, the grappling for position, the sheer, brutal Darwinism of the event.
