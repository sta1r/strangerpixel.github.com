I really dig those business / tech / web / software gurus at <a href="http://www.37signals.com/">37signals</a>. I like their products (I use <a href="http://www.backpackit.com/?source=37s+home">Backpack</a> and <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/?source=37s+home">Basecamp</a> daily) and I like their <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/">blog</a> (Signal vs Noise is one of my favourite RSS subs).

About three months ago I embarked on one of 37signals' <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/893-workplace-experiments">workplace experiments</a>: the 4-day work week. At <a href="http://www.fashion.arts.ac.uk">London College of Fashion</a>, I'm lucky enough to be able to take advantage of a flexible working scheme, whereby an employee can work his 40 weekly hours around the 5 available working days. I've been working 4-day weeks, 10-hour days, from 8.30am to 6.30pm.

It's awesome, because it means:
<ul>
	<li>Your work becomes something you knuckle down to for a 4-day burst. You can approach it as a block of time and separate it from your 3 days off, and you start to think of your job less as something that basically dominates your life, and more as a temporary activity that you're going to focus on and get satisfaction from. </li>
	<li>Long weekends. Sundays are so much more spacious with a free Monday to follow; alternatively, they can be truly guilt-free if you used your Friday for domestic admin. 4-day weekend trips now don't require taking annual leave.</li>
	<li>More time for freelance web projects - this may seem self-defeating if it means I'm doing more work, but really it's about the ratio of focussed, proactive working vs wasted, bored time 'at work'.</li>
	<li>More time for biking.</li>
</ul>
Well, great, but from LCF's point of view, am I getting as much done? Yes, here's why:
<ul>
	<li>Longer days mean more hours to really get your teeth into a project. My most productive work arises not from grazing on different bits of tasks but from focussing on a single task exclusively until completion.</li>
	<li>I'm on average fresher and more energised (or at least more committed) during 4 days than I am during 5. I can see the carrot of the weekend dangling clearer than the 5-dayers, I'm incentivised. </li>
	<li>I get early nights during the work part of my week and save parties for the weekend - hey, I've got the time! </li>
</ul>
Jason Fried makes a <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1209-forbes-misses-the-point-of-the-4-day-work-week">useful point</a> though - that by adopting this schedule you're not necessarily talking about cramming as much work into a shorter time. In fact, you're looking for <em>better</em>, <em>smarter</em>, but <em>shorter</em> working.
