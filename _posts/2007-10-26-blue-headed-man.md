title: 'Blue headed man'

---

This looks like a scene from Saw III, but really it's a <a href="http://www.fashion.arts.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/ba_costume_technical_effects_and_makeup.htm">Technical Effects</a> project by some students at LCF. The guy volunteered to have his head cast in aid of a piece of project work for one of his flatmates. He's totally sealed in but breathing from 2 airholes around his nostrils, communicating with hand movements and grunts. Weird experience I reckon.
