This week saw the launch of <a href="http://www.thepoliticsintheroom.org/">The Politics in the Room</a>, a video website presenting a collaborative project by members of the <a href="http://flamin.filmlondon.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=1431">Lux Associate Artists' Programme</a>. A full project write-up will follow, but for now you can read some background info on the <a href="http://www.thepoliticsintheroom.org/credits.html">credits page</a>, then browse the latest films.
