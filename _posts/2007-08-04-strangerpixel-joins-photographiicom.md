title: 'Strangerpixel joins photographii.com'

---

Recently I was invited to have a gallery at <a href="http://jasonpogo.org">Jason Pogo</a>'s website <a href="http://www.photographii.com">photographii.com</a>. Pogo has long offered his own work via this site - <a href="http://photographii.com/jasonpogo/">fantastic stuff</a> involving lots of quirky angles, close-ups, textures, black & white, as well as people, actual people (a place I've yet to go with my own photography) - but has now decided to make it a community site for photographers he invites to take part. My pics are <a href="http://www.photographii.com/strangerpixel/">now live</a>.<strong>A bit more about Pogo:</strong>
Pogo used to live in Edinburgh with my friend <a href="http://analysislost.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=12&Itemid=28">Colin Perry</a>, contributing to numerous projects in the <a href="http://www.analysislost.com/">Analysis Lost</a> stable. He now lives in San Francisco, where, as well as being a photographer, he is also a musician and designer - and just really tech in general. Just as one example, in his spare time he does things like <a href="http://www.internetmusicplayer.org/">this open source Flash mp3 player</a> and <a href="http://www.theforest.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=178&Itemid=219">this internet radio player for the Forest Caf√©</a>. If you click through just one link on this post, make it this one, to Pogo's <a href="http://panography.org/jasonpogo/">Panography gallery</a>.
