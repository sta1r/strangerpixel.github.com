title: 'Busted bike'

London cycle commuting takes its toll on any bike. I'm currently on about 45 minutes per day, possibly my swiftest trip ever to and from work in this frantic bottlenecked city. My general philosophy is 'ride it 'til it breaks' - but this naturally can mean that I'll be riding up Portland Place quite happily, and this will happen:

Severe, but not enough to prevent me from getting home (on a deflated tyre). 

I've had worse. Last year, I'd been noticing strange cracking noises for months before I eventually inspected the frame, to discover this:
