Like, I assume, many others interested in web design and new media, I've signed up for a preview of the new <a href="http://www.times.co.uk">times.co.uk</a> and <a href="http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk">thesundaytimes.co.uk</a> websites - free for a limited period before the hotly-anticipated paywall is erected. I'm eager to discover what kick-ass new web content the Times is going to deliver to reward our regular payments; I'm looking for some lavish investment in state-of-the-art multimedia techniques, live streaming, interactive maps, geo-located reporters, 3D everything. I want to see Reuters and CNN shamed by a blizzard of tech.<!--more-->Some thoughts:

<strong>Visual Design</strong>
<ul>
	<li>At first glance, times.co.uk looks like <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">guardian.co.uk</a>, but with less finesse. To be honest, it's a tough act to follow.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Typography</strong>
<ul>
	<li>It's Georgia and Arial again. The main issue is the line-height of the body text, which is 1.077 (for some reason) and should really be at least 1.2 to give the lines some breathing space. The text looks very congested.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Navigation</strong>

A serious challenge to organise such a mountain of content, but the Times scores with some nifty touches:
<ul>
	<li>Via a small panel of icons in the top right, you can organise the page to view an ordered list of breaking news items</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>This 'breaking news' view can be filtered using AJAX (would be great to filter by theme / genre e.g. "sport")</li>
</ul>

	<li>The section pop-out menu is crisp and clear, giving you space to choose within a section before diving in.</li>

<strong>Content management</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The Sunday Times Culture Planner is excellent. I particularly like the links to Sky+ remote record on select programmes. I don't know - maybe lots of listings sites use this now, but it was new to me.</li>
</ul>
