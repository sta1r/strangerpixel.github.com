A few months back I pulled off another against-the-clock website build. Last-minute seems to be a trend among <a href="http://www.strangerpixel.com/news/you-touched-me/">fashion designers</a>. MA student <a href="http://www.fionacampbellshoes.com" target="_blank">Fiona Campbell</a> needed a site in advance of her forthcoming exhibition at <a href="http://www.fashion.arts.ac.uk" target="_blank">London College of Fashion</a>. Fiona specialises is sustainable footwear, and wanted to use a website to promote her expertise online and offer consulting services.

Thankfully we had some great photos to work with, and after a bit of to-and-fro we settled on a calm, muted visual feel with a mix of blues and slate grey. While I put the structure together, <a href="http://www.tinypla.net/" target="_blank">Si</a> came into play with an easy-to-use blogging tool so Fiona could publish news snippets and keep the site fresh.
