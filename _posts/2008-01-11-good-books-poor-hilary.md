title: 'Good books, poor Hilary'

---

I read 2 really exceptional books over Christmas:
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Road-Cormac-McCarthy/dp/0330447548/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1200054499&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">The Road by Cormac McCarthy</a> - Buy it, read it, it's incredible.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Chesil-Beach-Ian-McEwan/dp/0099512793/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1200054470&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">On Chesil Beach by Ian McEwan</a> - Similarly brilliant.</li>
</ol>
And I started 1 book:
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Beyond-Black-Hilary-Mantel/dp/0007157762/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1200054371&amp;sr=8-2" target="_blank">Beyond Black by Hilary Mantel</a></li>
</ol>
I never finished it. From my prior knowledge, Mantel is no shabby writer, but oh dear. She just couldn't even vaguely compete with the big boys.
