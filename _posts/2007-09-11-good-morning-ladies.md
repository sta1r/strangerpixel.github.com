title: 'Good morning ladies'

---

Most mornings are like any other at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fashion.arts.ac.uk">London College of Fashion</a>. But not this morning. Walking through the Fashion Space Gallery in the direction of my office, I found the door blocked by a huddle of females. When they didn't disperse, I photographed them.

Turns out these mannequins were part of a design competition for high street retailers, the theme being recycling, and the reuse of materials ordinarily discarded during the fashion design process. As I write, <a href="http://www.heartfm.co.uk" target="_blank" >Heart FM</a> is outside in the gallery doing a feature on the competition. Entrants include <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wedgwood.com/">Wedgwood</a> and <a href="http://www.playboy.com" target="_blank" >Playboy</a>.

Just as a footnote to this post, I'm not unhealthily obsessed by <a href="http://www.strangerpixel.com/albums/index.php?album=inside&image=wigs3-web.jpg">mannequins</a> or <a href="http://www.strangerpixel.com/albums/index.php?album=inside&image=mannequin1.jpg">wigs</a>.
