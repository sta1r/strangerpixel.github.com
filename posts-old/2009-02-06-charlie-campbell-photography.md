I'm very pleased to announce the launch of <a href="http://www.charliecampbell.co.uk/">www.charliecampbell.co.uk</a>, a portfolio website for my photographer friend Charlie Campbell.

Charlie and I started the project back in October, and have worked together to create a minimal website design to showcase her collection of portraits, personal photography and documentary work. The site looks simple, but there's a fair bit of complexity under the hood.
