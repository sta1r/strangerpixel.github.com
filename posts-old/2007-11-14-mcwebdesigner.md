In mid-October <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/" target="_blank">A List Apart</a> published <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/2007surveyresults/" target="_blank">findings</a> from their <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/webdesignsurvey/" target="_blank">Web Design Survey</a>. <!--more-->
Data was drawn from a survey of 32,831 web professionals (48% in the US). The findings make for interesting reading; the analysis document itself is nicely designed, thorough and lucid. The main discovery <em>I</em> drew from the report was that I am McWebDesigner: I have most of the generic characteristics of web professionals working in 2007. The McWebDesigner's traits are as follows:

<ul>
	<li>between 25-32</li>
	<li>male</li>
	<li>white</li>
	<li>has a Bachelor's degree</li>
	<li>goes by the title 'Web Designer' or 'Web Developer' (the latter marginally more popular)</li>
	<li>is a full-time web worker</li>
	<li>has spent 2-3 years in the field</li>
	<li>has a personal site / blog (which has been online for around 1 year)</li>
	<li>earns $Â£ per year (I'm not seriously going to disclose that - check the doc if you must know!)</li>
	<li>works 40-50 hours a week</li>
	<li>claims skills in HTML, CSS and PHP</li>
	<li>is frequently 'excited by the field'</li>
</ul>
So far so shared by me. However, I am bucking the odd trend as well:
<ul>
	<li>I work for a university</li>
	<li>I get more paid holiday than the average</li>
	<li>I also have a Master's qualification</li>
	<li>I don't perceive writing / editing to be a gap in my skills (only 54% of respondents claimed skills in this area, making these the least claimed skills overall)</li>
</ul>
Got more time? Crunch some <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/2007surveyresults" target="_blank">raw data</a>.
