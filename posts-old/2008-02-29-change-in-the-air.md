I've decided to move my albums to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/strangerpixel/">Flickr</a> and upgrade to a Pro account. <a href="http://www.zenphoto.org">Zenphoto</a> may be free and <a href="http://www.zenphoto.org/category/News/">better than ever</a>, but for exposure, community and inspiration, it's got to be Flickr. Since I made the switch I've been practically addicted.

The other reason for the switch is that I'm re-designing this website. It's been over a year, and it needs a freshen up. More of which very soon.
