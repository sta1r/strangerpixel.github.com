I watched Current TV for the first time tonight, and it's been something of a revelation. Mainly, TV has become peripheral in my day-to-day media experience - the web is my number one focus, and anyway, clearly, most TV is rubbish. But Current TV is just gripping: 8-minute segments, created by viewers, pinging around the world and from subject to subject with this slick, perky style, nicely designed graphics, and progress bars to tell you how far you are through a programme. It's very webby, offering loads of links that you can check out while viewing, but the producers also know to mix laddish content (I just watched something about the next Jackie Chan) with current affairs and documentary-style content (like features on what matters to Buddhists in Nepal). The <a href="http://uk.current.com/">website</a> is pretty nice too.
