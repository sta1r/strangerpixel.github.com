Look, what is <em>wrong</em> with Firefox? I run version 2.0.0.8 on Mac, and it crashes frequently, sometimes as often as 3 times in a day-long session. And then a couple of times during an evening session on my laptop. If it weren't for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843">Firebug</a> and the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60">Developer Toolbar</a>, I'd be long gone...
Hitting the 'share on facebook' toolbar button will crash the 'Fox reliably. What gives?
