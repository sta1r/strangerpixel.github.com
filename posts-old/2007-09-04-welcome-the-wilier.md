The above is a new arrival to the <a href="http://www.strangerpixel.com">strangerpixel</a> cycle stable. Sweet, awesome - these don't cover it. Compared to my Scott Expert (01?), this bike is like a rocket: quick, flickable, stiff under pressure, compliant over rough surfaces, sure on the descents. Classy. It turns heads.

When I test rode the Wilier about a fortnight ago, the unexpected feeling of power and speed on a climb were better than a year's supply of Floyd Landis's testosterone patches. It was so exciting I nearly burst a lung firing up Rosslyn Hill.

I pondered the Wilier's rivals: efficient German engineering in the shape of the Focus Cayo on the one hand, on the other the undeniable quality of the US bike giant Trek. But I came back, remembering that first acceleration.
