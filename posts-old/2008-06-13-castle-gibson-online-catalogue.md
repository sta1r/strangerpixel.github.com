For the past month or so I have been working on a big project for <a href="http://www.castlegibson.com/" target="_blank">Castle Gibson</a>, the restored furniture retailer. Castle Gibson have decided to close their bricks-and-mortar treasure trove on Upper St in Islington and focus mainly on location hire, with a small selection of hand-picked props and furniture for sale via their website.

In collaboration with Wall Creative, who designed the visual layout, Simon and I built a <a href="http://www.castlegibson.com/items/" target="_blank">catalogue and shopping cart system</a>. The user interface is clean and simple: browsers can click on an image from the thumbnail grid to view larger images in the main window, or use the catalogue menu. If they're interested in an item, they can add it to their enquiry, then click submit.

The user-friendly admin area is arguably the <em>pièce de résistance</em> though. It makes the business of uploading images to the catalogue and choosing how to display them a breeze.
