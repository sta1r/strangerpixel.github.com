title: 'Web design'

<a href="http://www.strangerpixel.com">Strangerpixel</a> is re-launching. I'm building a new website around the <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> blogging software, combining an online web design portfolio with a separate section which will contain a blog, links to stats, sport stuff, and other non-work content. I also want to integrate the new site with a <a href="http://www.zenphoto.org/">zenphoto</a> gallery to showcase my photography.
