I've really enjoyed browsing the archives of amateur photographer Charles W. Cushman, who from 1938 until the '60s toured his native USA and the cities of the world. Cushman worked in business finance and law, but always took his Contax II A camera with him on his travels, documenting the architecture and people he encountered. Indiana University has scanned Cushman's <a href="http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/cushman/browse/index.jsp">entire collection</a> and put it online.

Thanks to <a href="http://blog.include-digital.com/">Include Digital</a> for this one.
