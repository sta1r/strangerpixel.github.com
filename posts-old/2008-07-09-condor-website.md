By now you ought to know that I love cycling and <a href="http://www.strangerpixel.com/category/bike/">bikes</a>. I'm also pretty keen on web design. So when a bike manufacturer I really like gets a new website, I'm excited.

<img class="blog alignnone size-full wp-image-93" title="condor" src="http://www.strangerpixel.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/condor.jpg" alt="Condor website screengrab" width="470" height="406" /><a href="http://www.condorcycles.com/"></a>

<a href="http://www.condorcycles.com/">Condor Cycles</a>, the iconic London bike builder, race team and brand name, had a 'coming soon' holding page on its site for most of 2007 - for so long, in fact, that I almost got in touch to offer my services. But I just checked back, and they've relaunched!

Here are some of the things wrong with the site:
<ul>
	<li>Sloppy code: the visual elements of the site rely on Flash, and there's no text content, or keyword or description metadata, so it's no surprise the site doesn't show up on the first page of Google for a search for 'london bike shop'.</li>
	<li>Dodgy user interface: I know what they were trying to do with the 'virtual catalogue', but the Flash page turner tool is fiddly to use and doesn't encourage browsing, even if there are additional buttons for 'next page' and 'previous page' on certain screens. What happens if I want to download an image of one of the bikes or email to a friend? I can't.Â </li>
	<li>The 'store opening hours' page opens in a new window. A minor point, arguably, but the issue that prompted this post. <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/07/01/should-links-open-in-new-windows/">Here's why you shouldn't do this</a> on a single domain - or indeed ever.</li>
</ul>
So why use Flash, really? Can it be easy for Condor staff to update details in their catalogue? No - there's no product database feeding into the site. In 2009 when their new bikes are launched, they'll have to start over.

What Condor needs, to do justice to their <a href="http://www.allinlondon.co.uk/directory/1284/2866.php">excellent store</a>, solid reputation and superb bikes, is:
<ul>
	<li>A clear, accessible site designed in standards-compliant HTML and CSS, to boost its search engine rankings and improve navigability.</li>
	<li>A better catalogue system that displays pages to the browser transparently, with unique URLs per product, and which the store staff can update easily.</li>
</ul>
<div>Next time I'm in to pick up new inner tubes, it may be time for a quiet word with the manager...</div>
