A quick shout out to <a href="http://jotta.com/">Jotta</a> (formerly Fifzine), the creative arts portfolio website that has recently relaunched. I like the new design: it's certainly more navigable, and the lightbox widget seems to work well. Generally though I think Jotta are OK because they've featured <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/strangerpixel/463244521/">one of my photographs</a> on the home page! 

However... I could do with more ways to browse other profiles - that big 'advanced search' box in <a href="http://jotta.com/jotta/introexplore">Explore</a> feels at odds with the idea of browsing freely. This is something we in the <a href="http://www.arts.ac.uk/webnetwork/">University of the Arts London web team</a> thought a lot about when designing <a href="http://www.arts.ac.uk/showtime/explore/">Showtime</a>. We modelled the site on <a href="http://ffffound.com/">FFFound</a>, because we liked the way you can casually browse without having to think of search criteria or narrow your search in advance. 

I'd also like to see Jotta plugging in to some APIs - <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">Linkedin</a> for example - to lift it above being 'just another (closed) network'...
