I'd like to applaud the redesign of the <a href="http://www.londonphoenix.co.uk/">London Phoenix Cycle Club</a>.

The visual design is really bold and striking, the blog is packed with content, it's got an embedded Google calendar with events up to May '09, a forum - is there a better bike club website in the UK?
