Probably when we should have been working, we were tumbling.

A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblelog" target="_blank">tumblelog</a> is essentially a blog without the baggage. You <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/register" target="_blank">set it up for free</a> in seconds, then publish your links, images, movies, quotes, whatever. For me it comes into its own by serving as an RSS feed aggregator: you can publish your <a href="http://del.icio.us/" target="_blank">del.icio.us</a> links into it, as well as your <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/strangerpixel">Flickr photostream</a> and loads of other bits - then feed it all back out again.

<a href="http://project.ioni.st/" target="_blank">Projectionist</a> is reliably offered as the daddy of the tumblr, while <a href="http://makenosound.com/" target="_blank">Max Wheeler</a>'s <a href="http://penguinclassics.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Penguin Classics tumblr</a> had many of us wishing we'd tried it first. For the record, here are <a href="http://strangerpixel.tumblr.com/">mine</a> (which switches between colour-riot and ultra-minimalist about every 5 days) and <a href="http://www.kikoku.co.uk/" target="_blank">Si's</a>.
