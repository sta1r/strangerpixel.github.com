title: 'You Touched Me'

---

This week I created a new website for MA fashion student Walter Buchholz.  <a target="_blank" title="You Touched Me" href="http://www.youtouchedme.com">You Touched Me</a> is a project that raises money for charity by creating T-shirts - but not just ordinary T-shirts. Walter imbues his fabric with meaning and history before cutting it into shape; he buries his fabric, leaves it in rivers, posts it to far-flung destinations or drapes it over public monuments. His idea is to add value and a unique sense of experience to wearing the end product.

'Celebrity-touched' T-shirts is Walter's latest project. Hopefully we'll have some photos of his fabric being touched by somebody famous very soon...
