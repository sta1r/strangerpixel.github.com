My most recent project is a commission to relaunch the web presence of the <a href="http://www.kraszna-krausz.org.uk" target="_blank">Kraszna-Krausz Foundation</a>. The Foundation, a charitable trust bequeathed by the Hungarian artist, photographer and publisher Andor Kraszna-Krausz, has run annual book awards since 1985. This year, in association with the National Museum of Photography, Film & Television, the awards are being relaunched, and - clearly - a new website is in order.
