title: 'Ride it, Gilligan'

---

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Gilligan">Andrew Gilligan</a>, the chubby <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3082323.stm">whistleblower</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodgy_Dossier">dodgy dossier</a>, has become a keen cyclist. Now a lean bike nerd, Gilligan wrote recently in the Evening Standard that he has lost 4 stone in just over a year. More interesting was what he said about cycling vs public transport:


<blockquote>'I used to think I could put up with the Underground. It was only when I stopped using it that I realised how life-shortening it is... It wasn't just the service... It was the crowds, the heat, the filthy air, the endless moronic announcements, the kids playing music on their mobile phones, the pushing and shoving, all of which delivered me to my destination in a low-level bad temper.'

'Part of cycling's appeal for me is that it is a last outpost of freedom in an authoritarian, CCTV city, essentially uncontrolled by anyone except the cyclist.</blockquote>

Happy biking AG.
